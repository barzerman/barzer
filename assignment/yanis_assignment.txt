*. basic semantical routines - 
	- repeated stop tokens (consecutive same tok id) need to be absorbed into the first one
*. stop words handling 
*. document barzel trie matching algo 
*. barzer_standard_entity.h/.cpp (gen.price, gen.distance ...) class ubclass translator
*. entity range combo enhanced (with units)
*. reduce the size of barzel trie node part II 
	- pool translations. this is important because if rule has 100 emissions and translation is a rewriter
	  then 100 identical rewriters will be created - no need for that. also, having translation ids is 
	  essential for barzel variables
		1. Trie::addPath called from el_parse should pool the translation and pass tranid instead of the node in
	- wc lookups are very costly and vast majority of these nodes are identical 
		1. perhaps instead of wcLookup this should simply be a variant including among other things 
			BarzelTrieNode (bypassing the whole map/keys nonsense) for cases when there's only one wc node - this is 
			a reasonable assumption - most date patterns would have one wc child per number node (!)
*. barzel variable names support 
	1. there needs to ba  a global table mapping variable and translation id (see above) to trie nodes. in fact the map should 
	be of a chain of varids + one tran id to multiple trie nodes. probably best is:
		map[transid, trie[ varname, trie[ ..] ] ]
*. multiple tries support
