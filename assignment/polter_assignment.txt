1. Make simple configurable logger .  DElivery date April 13
	- make it part of aylib ay_logger
	- singleton loads an optional config file which controls the log level
	- statements like AYTRACE/AYDEBUG depends on the trace level
	- trace level should also be controllable from the shell 
Basically it should print the same as AYDEBUG/AYTRACE except that the actual printing 
will only occur when appropriate tracelevel is set. 
Also, there should be a compile time flag to remove all print statements (#ifdef)
